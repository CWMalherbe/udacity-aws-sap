Availability Estimate

1. Minimum RTO for a Single AZ Outage
If a single Availability goes down and the RDS database has been configured with multi-az, fail-over happens autiomatically, it can take a few minutes depending 
on the size of the database.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
RTO - Recovery time objective indicates the time objective we are striving for to get the database back online 
and operational.
Fail-over does not happen automatically in the case of a regional outage.
Support staff must identify the cause of the outage when notified and then 
promote the secondary instance to be the new master, and then route the  database 
traffic to the new endpoint


3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
It only takes a few minutes to fail over to another AZ, so a few minutes of data will be lost.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
The Recovery Point Objective describes the volume of data that may be lost due to the outage.
The Recovery Point Objective depends on the backup frequency that is configured.
If we set up an RDS database with automatic backups enabled, the RPO will be based on 
how often data is backed up. If we set up a backup every 4 hours, the minimum RPO will be 4 hours.
